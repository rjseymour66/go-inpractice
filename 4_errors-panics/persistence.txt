The StorageClass object defines a type of external storage that you can use to provision PersistentVolumes. A PV is a unit of storage that is made available to persist pod data. Each pod mounts in its filesystem a PVC, a mechanism that requests storage of a certain StorageClass. When a PVC requests storage of a specific StorageClass, the operator finds a PV that uses the same StorageClass as the PVC that issued the request and binds the PVC to the PV.
